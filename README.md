# Android MVVM Architecture Sample (ViewModel + LiveData + Kotlin + Retrofit) - Weather App
### Project Description
 In order to fetch weather data for that current location ,user need to hit the `View Weather` button. Then App will send request to Open Weather web API and show the weather information in the UI.

### Open Weather API
We will use [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for collecting weather information. To get the real weather information of a city, you need to sign up and get your own `APP ID`. Otherwise you can test the API with their sample `BASE URL` and sample `APP ID` without creating account.

### Project Setup
Clone the project and open it using Android Studio. Then open your `local.properties` file under `Gradle Scripts`. You need to specify the `base_url` and `app_id` in your `local.properties` file. Store your API secret in plain string file or Kotlin file is very risky. For security purpose it's better store in local.properties file than plain string/Kotlin file.

#### Use Sample API without creating account
Add below lines at the end of your `local.properties` file. Then run the project. You'll get dummy or static API response from Open Weather API.
```properties
#this is sample Base URL
base_url=https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/

#this is sample App ID of Open Weather API
app_id=1bba3df0a2c0faf5ea29c12655867b1d
```
#### Use Real APP ID after sign up and activation of your APP ID
After Sign up at the website collect your own `APP ID` from their [API Keys page](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Then add below lines with your APP ID at the end of `local.properties` file.
```properties
#this is real Base URL
base_url=http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/

#this is real App ID of Open Weather API
app_id=YOUR_OWN_APP_ID
```
The BASE URL and APP ID will be fetched from `build.gradle` file and will be stored it in `BuildConfig`. And `Retrofit` API call will use the BASE URL and APP ID from `BuildConfig`.
